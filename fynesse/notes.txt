The 2021-ts062-oa census (https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_bulk):
    I have confirmed that the "date" column always contains 2021 thus is redundant.
    I have also confirmed that the "geography" column is always the same as the "geography code" column.
    I have confirmed that "geography" is unique (thus can be made a primary key).
